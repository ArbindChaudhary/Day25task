# TASK: OBJECT ORIENTED
# 1.	Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

import math
C=50
H=30
D=[]
result=[]
Dval=input("Enter the value of D:")
D=Dval.split(",")
D= [int(i)for i in D]
i=0
l=len(D)

while (i<1):
    Q=(math.sqrt((2*C*D[i])/H))
    result.append(Q)
    i+=1
    print("The Squareroot of given value is:", result)




# 2.Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.

class Shape():
    def area(self, a,b):
        x= a*b
        print("The area of the given value is:", +x)



class Sqr():
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length=  length*length    
        print("The square of the given value is:", +self.length)   

S= Shape()
sq=Sqr(3)

S.area(5,10)
sq



# 3.Create a class to find the three elements that sum to zero from a set of n real numbers.
# Input array: [-25,-10,-7,-3,2,4,8,10]
# Output: [[-10,2,8],[-7,-3,10]]

                    if (arg[i] + arg[j] + arg[k] == 0):

# 4.          What is the output of the following code? Explain your answer as well.
# class Test:

# 5.	Create a Time class and initialize it with hours and minutes.

# Make a method displayTime which should print the time.
# Make a method DisplayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time. E.g.- (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minute.

# 6.           Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:
# yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
# amIOld()  should perform the following conditional actions:
# If , print You are young..
# If  and , print You are a teenager..
# Otherwise, print You are old..	
# Sample Input:
# 4
# -1
